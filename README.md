# CodingSamurai_SentimentAnalysis

The pickle fies and python files are for the user interface which is deployed by streamlit . 
after saving the file you can write 'streamlit run sentiment.py' on your cmd to interact with that interface.
The fully functional code is in Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb . Thanks
